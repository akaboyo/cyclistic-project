# PROJECT 1 - CYCLISTIC BIKESHARE CAPSTONE PROJECT

## Introduction

This is a capstone project as a part of my [Google Data Analytics Professional Certificate](https://www.coursera.org/professional-certificates/google-data-analytics) course.
For the analysis, I will be using R programming language and [RStudio](www.rstudio.com) IDE because it is easy for statistical analysis and data visualizations.

This report aims to analyze the usage patterns of annual members and casual riders of Cyclistic, a bike-share company in Chicago. The objective is to provide insights to the marketing analyst team to design a new marketing strategy to convert casual riders into annual members. The data used for this analysis is the Cyclistic historical bike trip data.

For this project, the following data analysis steps were followed :

 * Ask
 * Prepare
 * Process

# PROJECT 2 - TOP 100 COMPANIES IN THE US PROJECT

## Overview: Web Scraping the Top 100 Companies in the US using Python

This project involves building a Python-based web scraper to collect data on the top 100 companies in the United States. The aim is to gather key information such as company names, market capitalization, stock prices, industry sectors, and financial performance metrics. The scraped data can be used for analysis, reporting, or integrated into financial dashboards.

#### Key Components:
1. Web Scraping Libraries: The project utilizes Python libraries like `BeautifulSoup` and `requests` to parse HTML content and extract relevant data from reputable websites such as Fortune 500, Forbes, or stock market aggregators.
  
2. Data Collection: The scraper fetches data on:
   - Company Name
   - Ranking
   - Industry Sector
   - Revenue (USD millions)
   - Revenue Growth
   - No. of Employees
   
3. Data Storage: The scraped data is cleaned and stored in a structured format such as CSV or a database (e.g., SQLite), ensuring it can be easily accessed for further analysis.

4. Data Analysis: Once collected, the data can be analyzed to find trends in industries, company performance, or create visual reports using libraries like `Pandas` and `Numpy`.

This project showcases practical web scraping, data handling, and analysis skills that can be applied to financial market research or business intelligence applications.
