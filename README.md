# [CYCLISTIC BIKESHARE CAPSTONE PROJECT](#cyclistic-bikeshare-capstone-project)

## Introduction

This is a capstone project as a part of my [Google Data Analytics Professional Certificate](https://www.coursera.org/professional-certificates/google-data-analytics) course.
For the analysis, I will be using R programming language and [RStudio](www.rstudio.com) IDE because it is easy for statistical analysis and data visualizations.

This report aims to analyze the usage patterns of annual members and casual riders of Cyclistic, a bike-share company in Chicago. The objective is to provide insights to the marketing analyst team to design a new marketing strategy to convert casual riders into annual members. The data used for this analysis is the Cyclistic historical bike trip data.

For this project, the following data analysis steps were followed :

 * Ask
 * Prepare
 * Process
 * Analyze 
 * Share
 * Act
